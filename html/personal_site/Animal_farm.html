  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>
    Animal Farm begins with a very drunk Mr. Jones (owner of Manor Farm) doing
    a really crummy job of, you know, his job. Luckily, there's a wise pig on
    the farm: Old Major. Old Major encourages the neglected animals to rebel
    and run the farm themselves with one important qualification: everyone
    should be equal. Then he dies. This seems like a grand idea to everyone
    except Benjamin, a cynical donkey whose main job in life is to be, well,
    cynical. So, they rebel.
    <br />
    The pigs, being the <span style="color: red">smartest animals</span> ,
    naturally take the leadership role. So much for that equality business. So
    much for Old Major's vision of a peaceful coup, too, because there's
    immediate conflict between two pigs, Napoleon and Snowball. Napoleon wants
    to sit around and be in charge of everything, while Snowball wants to
    teach the other animals and build a windmill. Obviously, Snowball's plan
    is way better, so he wins.
    <br />
    Not. Instead, Napoleon uses his private army of nine ferocious and
    enormous dogs to become the All Powerful Dominant Boss Leader Chief Pig.
    Okay, he doesn't call it that, but you know it's in the back of his mind
    somewhere. With Snowball out of the picture, the other pigs blame
    everything on him. They exploit the other animals shamelessly, breaking
    all the rules about equality that they had established after the
    Rebellion. Life on the farm gets worse and worse, the animals forget old
    Major's original dream, and the pigs make some poor management decisions
    when dealing with the neighboring farms. The culminating miserable moment
    comes when the pigs send Boxer, a hardworking and loyal horse who is ready
    for retirement, to his death. Ouch. In short, the pigs are starting to
    look a lot like the horrible human owners that we started with at the
    beginning of this whole mess, walking on two legs and everything. In fact,
    they may even be worse.
