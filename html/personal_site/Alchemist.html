  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Paulo Coelho’s</strong> enchanting novel in the eclectic
    <span style="color: red">“magical realism”</span> category is dazzling in
    many ways. The style reads simply yet contains powerful emotions,
    interesting and deep characters, plots twists and inspiring wisdom. An
    Andalusian shepherd boy named Santiago travels from his homeland in Spain
    to the Egyptian desert in search of a treasure buried in the Pyramids. He
    is both a simple sheep herder and an ambitious explorer. He follows his
    dreams, literally, a well as “signs” from his environment. Our main
    character is thoughtful beyond his years but also a child subject to being
    impressionable. Along the way he meets a Gypsy woman, a man who calls
    himself king (is he really a king? who should he believe?), a man who
    claims to be an alchemist (is he really an alchemist who can turn metal to
    gold?) and then a real alchemist who doesn’t brag at all. Each character
    points Santiago in the direction of his quest. No one knows what the
    treasure is, or if Santiago will be able to surmount the obstacles along
    the way. He hits dead ends, someone steals his money, he trusts
    incorrectly, he gets captured in the desert, etc… but amazing things
    happen as well and the plot always moves forward. Tides turn. He arguably
    changes his own destiny with his actions. <br />
    Santiago must wrestle with what he is told vs. what is real. But what
    starts out as a journey to find worldly goods turns into a discovery of
    the treasure found within – the fine line between reality and the
    spiritual. He moves from hopeless to hopeful and back again throughout the
    story. He even meets Fatima, love at first sight, in a massive desert
    oasis. His quest, coupled with the magical realism genre might leave the
    reader with questions. Did Santiago truly summon the sandstorm that led to
    his escape in the desert or was it a coincidence? Did he really feel
    Fatima’s kiss on his cheek at the end, or was it just a sense or longing
    to fulfill his promise to return to her? Lush, evocative, and full of
    awesome quotes about being, the story of Santiago is a real (and slightly
    magical) representation of the transforming power of our dreams, whether
    real or imagined, people in our lives and the importance of listening to
    our hearts.
