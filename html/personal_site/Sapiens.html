    <strong>Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind</strong> by Yuval Noah
    Harari describes the development of the human species, who refers to as
    Sapiens. It begins in the earliest stages of evolution and ends at the
    present day with some broad predictions for humanity’s future. Harari
    states that our history is divided by four major revolutions. The first of
    these Cognitive Revolution, at which point the species developed cognitive
    abilities that far exceeded those of other humans. The Agricultural
    Revolution, which occurred 10,000 years ago, was the point at which humans
    domesticated plants and animals for cultivation. 500 years ago, the
    Scientific Revolution ushered in modern science, the age of exploration,
    and capitalism, thus creating many of the foundations on which today’s
    society relies. Finally, the Industrial Revolution, which started 200
    years ago, transformed humanity into the species we recognize today. A
    major theme throughout this book is that human lifestyles have not
    consistently improved throughout history. We generally believe that each
    advancement in technology led to better lives, but the author states
    definitively that hunter-gatherers enjoyed many advantages over their
    agricultural descendants. Though industrial humans have access to modern
    medicine and other important advances, our lifestyle remains far from
    perfect.

    Harari’s goal in writing this book is to determine why Sapiens are the
    sole surviving human species and why they, as unremarkable apes, came to
    dominate the planet. Sapiens’ advantage, he argues, rests in our unique
    ability to communicate ideas that do not actually exist. Though many
    species have well-developed linguistic abilities, Sapiens appear to be the
    only species that creates and communicates total fictions. This ability is
    extremely important because it allows to create shared myths, facilitating
    cooperation between massive groups of strangers. Throughout history,
    Sapiens developed money, empires, and religions, all of which are examples
    of shared myths. These institutions ordered human behavior, allowing us to
    develop the complex and advanced societies that we have today. Harari
    concludes that our species’s advancements have but on the brink of another
    major transition, as we transcend the boundaries of biology and natural
    selection and are able to engage in intelligent design.
