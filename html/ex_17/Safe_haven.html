  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Safe Haven (2010)</strong> , a romance novel by American author
    Nicholas Sparks, centers on Katie, a mysterious young woman who appears in
    a small North Carolina town, raising the attention of the townspeople.
    Although she seems determined to avoid forming personal ties, she soon
    befriends both Alex, a widowed store owner with two kids, and her
    plainspoken neighbor, Jo. As she slowly begins to let down her guard, she
    finds herself growing closer to Alex and his family. However, the dark
    secret she carries still haunts her, and she is forced to choose between
    her safety, and seeking to truly be happy. Exploring themes of love, loss,
    secrets, and what it truly means to be safe, Safe Haven was another hit
    novel for the prolific Sparks. It was adapted into a 2013 feature film
    directed by Lasse Hallstrom and starring Julianne Hough, Josh Duhamel, and
    Cobie Smulders. Safe Haven begins as a young woman arrives in Southport,
    North Carolina. Her name is Erin, and she is fleeing her abusive,
    alcoholic husband, Kevin. Changing her name to Katie to avoid being found,
    she finds work at a local seafood restaurant and befriends her neighbor
    Jo, a single woman who lives alone. A visit to the town’s general store
    introduces her to Alex, the owner.

    A widower with two children, Alex is a kind man, and Katie instantly finds
    herself drawn to him. Alex and Katie soon develop a romantic relationship,
    which Jo encourages. After a while, Katie reveals her past to Alex and
    tells him about her husband. Alex wants to know why she did not go to the
    police, and Katie reveals that Kevin is a police detective. She believes
    he will kill her if he finds her, so she created a new identity based on
    the dead daughter of a neighbor who bore a resemblance to her. Kevin,
    meanwhile, has sunk deeper into his alcohol and rage. Obsessed with Erin,
    he finds out her new identity and searches for her. He eventually traces
    her to Southport and tracks her down when she is in Alex’s house, caring
    for Alex’s young children. Hoping to kill both his ex-wife and her new
    lover, he sets the house on fire and attacks Katie as she flees the house.
    She fights back while the children run for their lives. Alex finds his
    children and takes them to Katie’s house, then arrives home and finds
    Kevin attacking Katie. Kevin pulls a gun, and Alex drives the car at him
    desperate to stop him.

    Alex hits Kevin, breaking his hand and causing him to drop his gun. Katie
    grabs the gun, and she and Alex are reunited, but Kevin is able to get
    away. When Katie finds out that Alex took the kids to her home, sheis
    terrified that Kevin is going to go there next and hurt them. They race to
    Katie’s house, where they find Kevin attempting to break in. Kevin attacks
    Alex with a crowbar, then pulls the gun on Katie. He and Alex struggle,
    and the gun fires, hitting Kevin in the stomach and killing him. After
    Alex and Katie recover from the injuries they sustained in the struggle
    with Kevin, Alex reveals that he has long held an unopened letter from his
    late wife, Carly. It is in a safe in the ruins of his home, and he and
    Katie dig it up from the rubble. Alex gives it to Katie, asking her to
    read it first. She goes home, and is shocked to find that Jo’s house looks
    abandoned. Reading the letter, she sees that it is signed by “Carly Jo,”
    whom her friends called Jo. Katie realizes that her friend Jo was not whom
    she thought she was. She was the spirit of Carly Jo, looking after Alex
    from beyond the grave and making sure he found someone who would make him
    happy again. In the letter, Carly Jo addresses Katie, as if she knew the
    letter would find its way to her. She asks Katie to look after Alex and
    their children. After finishing the letter, Katie sees lights in Jo’s
    house, and sees Jo waving farewell to her from the window. However, when
    she looks again, the lights are gone and it looks as if no one has lived
    there for years. Jo has fulfilled her purpose and has moved on, and Katie
    and Alex are ready to begin their new life together. Nicholas Sparks is an
