  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>
    Hazel Grace Lancaster has been living with cancer for three of her
    seventeen years of life. Despite this, she is a girl with a vibrant mind,
    biting wit, and incredible empathy for the position into which she puts
    her parents of having to care for her. Her cancer began as thyroid cancer
    but spread to her lungs, causing her to need to breathe oxygen from a tank
    at all times throughout the day. She attends a support group at a church;
    there, she meets a friend named Isaac and a romantic interest named
    Augustus. Augustus has been in remission after losing his leg some years
    prior, so Hazel hesitates in starting a relationship with him, not wanting
    to hurt him if her illness takes another turn for the worse.
    <br />
    She introduces Augustus to her favorite book, and he forms a plan in which
    they will travel to Amsterdam together (using the "Wish" given to him by a
    foundation for children with cancer) to meet the reclusive and mysterious
    author and find out what happens after the book's end. They are able to
    take this trip, but when they arrive to meet the author he is drunk and
    surly. At the end of the trip, Augustus reveals to Hazel that his cancer
    has come back and is much worse than the previous time. They return home
    and Hazel stays by his side until his death. The author attends Augustus's
    funeral and tries to apologize to Hazel; she realizes that his book, which
    is about a young girl with cancer, was based on his daughter who died.
    Hazel copes with Augustus's death, comforting herself with the strength of
    her family and a letter about her that Augustus sent to the author before
    his death.
