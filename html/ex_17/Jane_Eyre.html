  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>
    When the novel begins, the title character is a 10-year-old orphan who
    lives with her uncle’s family; her parents had died of typhus. Other than
    the nursemaid, the family ostracizes Jane. She is later sent to the
    austere Lowood Institution, a charity school, where she and the other
    girls are mistreated; “Lowood,” as the name suggests, is the “low” point
    in Jane’s young life. In the face of such adversity, however, she gathers
    strength and confidence. In early adulthood, after several years as a
    student and then teacher at Lowood, Jane musters the courage to leave. She
    finds work as a governess at Thornfield Hall, where she meets her dashing
    and Byronic employer, the wealthy and impetuous
    <strong>Edward Rochester</strong> . <br />
    At Thornfield Jane looks after young Adèle, the daughter of a French
    dancer who was one of Rochester’s mistresses, and is befriended by the
    kindly housekeeper Mrs. Alice Fairfax. Jane falls in love with Rochester,
    though he is expected to marry the snobbish and socially prominent Blanche
    Ingram. Rochester eventually reciprocates Jane’s feelings and proposes
    marriage. However, on their wedding day, Jane discovers that Rochester
    cannot legally marry her, because he already has a wife, Bertha Mason, who
    has gone mad and is locked away on the third floor because of her violent
    behaviour; her presence explains the strange noises Jane has heard in the
    mansion. Believing that he was tricked into that marriage, Rochester feels
    justified in pursuing his relationship with Jane. He pleads with her to
    join him in France, where they can live as husband and wife despite the
    legal prohibitions, but Jane refuses on principle and flees Thornfield.
    Jane is taken in by people she later discovers are her cousins.
    <br />
    One of them is St. John, a principled clergyman. He gives her a job and
    soon proposes marriage, suggesting that she join him as a missionary in
    India. Jane initially agrees to leave with him but not as his wife.
    However, St. John pressures her to reconsider his proposal, and a wavering
    Jane finally appeals to Heaven to show her what to do. Just then, she
    hears a mesmeric call from Rochester. Jane returns to Thornfield to find
    the estate burned, set on fire by Rochester’s wife, who then jumped to her
    death. Rochester, in an attempt to save her, was blinded. Reunited, Jane
    and Rochester marry. Rochester later regains some of his sight, and the
    couple have a son.
